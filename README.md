HSSD: Habitat Synthetic Scene Dataset
==================================

We present the Habitat Synthetic Scene Dataset (HSSD): a human-authored 3D scene dataset that more closely mirrors real scenes than prior datasets. Our dataset represents real interiors and contains a diverse set of 211 scenes and more than 18000 models of real-world objects.
